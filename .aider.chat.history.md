Description:
On-Chain Reputation Score evaluates blockchain addresses based on their transaction history and activity, providing a clear “trustworthiness” metric. Use it to assess counterparties, DeFi participants, NFT traders, and more.

Key Features:
 • Calculates a reputation score based on on-chain activity, including transaction frequency, volume, and interaction with trusted protocols.
 • Visual analytics and history charts for each address.
 • Alerts for unusual activity or changes in reputation.
 • Support for multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.).
 • Easy lookup via wallet address or ENS name.

Target Users:
Crypto traders, NFT collectors, DeFi users, and anyone who wants to evaluate on-chain trustworthiness.

Usage Instructions:
 1. Enter a wallet address or ENS name.
 2. View the reputation score, historical trends, and key metrics.
 3. Set alerts for significant changes in reputation.
 4. Make informed decisions when interacting with unknown addresses.

Benefits:
 • Assess counterparty reliability before engaging in transactions.
 • Detect potential scams or risky addresses early.
 • Gain deeper insights into on-chain behavior for smarter decisions.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit its title and description. I will also create a new file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` for the app logo.

A stylized representation of a blockchain network with interconnected nodes forming a circular pattern, in a modern minimalist style. The background is a gradient from deep blue to teal, with the nodes in bright white and the connecting lines in a lighter blue. The overall design conveys trust, connectivity, and data flow, suitable for an on-chain reputation score app.
